        <h3>WHAT IS RAILS GIRLS?</h3>
        <p><strong>Rails Girls</strong> was founded to help you acquire the tools to build your ideas!<p>
        <p>If you still aren't sure what you want to be when you grow up, and you like to be challenged and get your hands dirty - our workshops are for you.
          In our 1.5 days-long workshop, you'll be grouped with another 1-2 woman and a coach, and build a web app step by step using the <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> programming language.
          <br/>No previous programming knowledge is required, and it's completely free!
