%p A few CSS changes will improve your ideas page event further!

%h3 Make the buttons columns widths smaller

%p
  Let's start with a small exercise:
  Add a CSS class named 
  %code buttons
  to all three 
  %code td
  tags that contain buttons.
  <br/>
  Done? Ask your coach to make sure you did it correctly.

%p 
  Now, open the file
  %code app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss
  and add this code at the end:

= preserve do 
  - code("css") do
    :plain
      td.buttons {
        width: 70px;
      }

%p
  Refresh the page, and notice that this change made the three right most columns smaller.

%h3 Centralize the page title

%p 
  The spacing above the page title is too large, and the spacing below it is too small. If we balance the top and bottom spacing it will look better.
  In the same CSS file replace the line:

= preserve do
  - code("css") do
    body { padding-top: 100px; }

%p with the line:

= preserve do
  - code("css") do
    body { padding-top: 80px; }

%p To add spacing below the page title add this CSS code at the bottom of the same file:

= preserve do
  - code("css") do
    h1 { margin-bottom: 30px; }

%p Refresh the page and notice the change.
