%p 
  =link_to 'Google Fonts', 'https://www.google.com/fonts'
  contains a collection of special fonts that can be added to any website for free. In this step we'll add a font called Arvo to your application.

%p 
  Open the file 
  %code app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
  and somewhere inside the
  %code &lthead&gt
  section, add this line:

= preserve do 
  - code("erb") do
    <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo:400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

%p
  In our CSS file
  %code app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss
  replace the line:

= preserve do 
  - code("css") do
    body { padding-top: 80px; }

%p with this code:

= preserve do 
  - code("css") do
    :plain
      body { 
        padding-top: 80px; 
        font-family: Arvo; 
      }    

%p Refresh the page and notice that the font has changed.
